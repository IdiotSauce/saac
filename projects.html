                    <dd> About a year ago, I begun developing a game based on an idea that came to me. However, making a game is a big undertaking!!! I don't have much time for it in college... but I still wanted to explore the characters and world. So I decided to turn it into a webcomic for the time being. It's coming soon!!! </dd>
